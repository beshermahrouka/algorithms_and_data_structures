    "In Assignment 1, I approached the problem by breaking down the requirements and identifying the key operations for each task. Starting with function definitions and type hints helped clarify each functionâ€™s role. I ran initial tests to validate basic functionality and adjusted the logic as necessary to handle edge cases. Working iteratively, I incorporated feedback from early test results to ensure the code met the assignment criteria.\n",

    "During the presentation, I explained my codeâ€™s approach and logic to my partner, highlighting areas where I encountered challenges and how I resolved them. This process of explaining decisions allowed me to better understand my code's strengths and areas that could benefit from additional optimization. Reviewing my partner's code provided valuable insights into alternative approaches and common issues, which helped me improve my own debugging skills.\n",

I was able to spot an error in their initial solution regarding missing number detection, and they helped me see possible improvements in my code structure.
